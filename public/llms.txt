## What is Positive Check?

Positive Check is an AI-powered patient check-in call service that helps healthcare providers monitor patient wellness at scale through automated, HIPAA-compliant phone calls. The platform's AI companion, Lola, conducts daily wellness calls covering medication adherence, sleep quality, mood, mobility, appetite, cognitive health, and symptom tracking. Actionable insights and real-time alerts are delivered to care teams through a secure provider dashboard.

## Who is it for?

Positive Check is built for healthcare providers, including:

- Hospitals and health systems (post-discharge follow-up)
- Primary care and specialty practices (chronic care management)
- Skilled nursing facilities and assisted living communities
- Home health agencies
- Population health and care management programs
