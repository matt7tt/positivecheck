# Next.js 15.2.3 Upgrade Guide

This guide outlines the steps to upgrade from Next.js 15.1.4 to Next.js 15.2.3 with minimal impact to the existing application.

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

1. **Backup Your Project**: Create a full backup of your project before starting.
2. **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure you're using Node.js 18.17 or later (recommended).
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   
3. **Git Branch**: Create a new branch for the upgrade.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b upgrade-next-15.2.3
   ```

## Step 1: Update Dependencies

1. **Update package.json**: Update Next.js and related packages.
   - Update `next` to version `^15.2.3`
   - Update `eslint-config-next` to version `15.2.3`

2. **Install Updated Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

## Step 2: Code Compatibility Checks

The upgrade from 15.1.4 to 15.2.3 is a minor version update and should have minimal breaking changes. However, check the following areas:

1. **Middleware**: No changes needed to the current middleware implementation.

2. **App Router**: The App Router architecture already in use is compatible with 15.2.3.

3. **Image Component**: Verify that next/image imports and usage remain compatible.

4. **API Routes**: No changes needed to the API route structure.

## Step 3: Testing

1. **Development Server**: Start the development server to test the application.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or 
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Test Key Functionality**:
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test the Phoenix landing page
   - Test the dashboard section
   - Test all form submissions
   - Verify API interactions

3. **Check for Console Errors**: Monitor the browser console and server logs for any errors.

## Step 4: Build and Deployment

1. **Build the Application**: Verify the build process works correctly.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   # or
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Check for Build Warnings**: Address any warnings that appear during the build process.

3. **Run Production Build Locally**: Test the production build locally before deploying.
   ```bash
   npm run start
   # or
   yarn start
   # or
   pnpm start
   ```

## Potential Issues and Solutions

1. **Experimental Features**: If you encounter issues with experimental features, check the updated syntax in Next.js 15.2.3.

2. **Middleware Changes**: If middleware behavior has changed, verify the redirection logic still works as expected.

3. **Image Optimization**: If images aren't displaying correctly, check the Image component props and configuration.

## Rollback Plan

If you encounter significant issues:

1. **Revert package.json**: Revert to the previous versions of Next.js and related dependencies.

2. **Clear Cache**: Clear npm/yarn cache and node_modules.
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm -rf .next
   npm cache clean --force
   # then reinstall
   npm install
   ```

3. **Use Git**: If you created a branch for the upgrade, you can easily revert to the previous state.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
