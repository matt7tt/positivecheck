          Caring for an aging loved one is a noble and rewarding responsibility, but it can also be emotionally and physically demanding. Caregiver burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion that can occur when caregivers don't get the help they need or try to do more than they're able. Understanding the signs and taking preventive measures is crucial for both the caregiver and their loved one.
